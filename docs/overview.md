# Overview

## 1. The Bad Old Days

- Physical servers
- “One app per server” → waste of resources
- Scaling = buying new hardware

## 2. Virtual Machines

- Multiple OS instances on one machine
- Benefits: isolation, better hardware utilization, flexibility
- Drawbacks: heavy, slow boot, duplication of OS overhead

## 3. Containers

- Share the host OS kernel → lightweight, fast
- Benefits: portability, consistency across environments, efficiency
- Example: Docker

## 4. Container Runtime & Ecosystem

- Runtimes: Docker, containerd, CRI-O
- Registries (Docker Hub, Harbor, ECR, GCR)
- Orchestration need arises → enter K8S

## 5. Container Orchestration

- Why we need it: scaling, high availability, self-healing, service discovery
- Options: K8S, Docker Swarm, Nomad
- K8S dominance today

## 6. DevOps & Containers

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- CI/CD pipelines with containers
- GitOps for declarative deployments

## 7. Modern Cloud-Native Landscape

- Microservices architectures
- Service meshes (Istio, Linkerd)
- Serverless containers (Knative, AWS Fargate)

## 8. Best Practices

- Security (least privilege, image scanning)
- Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
- Resource management

## 9. Future of Containerization

- WebAssembly (Wasm) vs Containers
- Edge & IoT use cases
- Containers as a building block, not the end game
